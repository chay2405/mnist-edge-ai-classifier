# Edge AI MNIST Image Classifier
This project implements an image classification model for the MNIST handwritten digit dataset using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is designed to be lightweight and optimized for edge device deployment using TensorFlow Lite.

## Features
- Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for digit classification
- Trained and evaluated on MNIST dataset
- Model conversion to TensorFlow Lite format for edge deployment
- Example inference with TFLite model on sample images

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.19.0
- Matplotlib 3.10.0

### Installation
Install required dependencies using:
pip install -r requirements.txt


### Usage

- Open the Jupyter notebook `Edge_AI_Image_Classifier_MNIST.ipynb` in Jupyter or Google Colab.
- Run the notebook cells sequentially to train, evaluate, and test the model.
- Inspect the saved model and TFLite conversion steps.
- Modify the notebook to experiment with model architecture or dataset.
